I use <span style="color: var(--color-accent); font-weight: bold;">Claude Code</span>. It's a terminal-based AI coding tool, and this blog started there - describing what I wanted built.

Terminal-first isn't new for me. Back in 2016, writing mortgages on a DOS system, I'd run three conversations at once - one family on the phone, two more in chat - structuring loans, printing docs, running pricing. No hand leaving the keyboard.

So Claude Code felt natural. But on anything complex, I kept hitting the same wall: <span style="color: var(--color-accent); font-weight: bold;">context management</span>. Agents lose focus when context gets too large. They forget earlier decisions.

I needed a system - a way to structure context for agents, manage memory through the filesystem, orchestrate parallel work. So I built one, and this blog was the first test.

I'm not an engineer. I don't write syntax. But I'm good at decomposing problems, and I've been practicing AI orchestration since 2022. I spend more time than I should thinking about agent memory and knowledge graphs. *"What gets documented gets done"* - my older brother taught me that. I wanted a blog to capture the learning.

  <strong>What's in it for you:</strong> See how I used Claude Code to orchestrate feature branches in parallel, and tackle starting a blog I otherwise wouldn't have made time for. The <a href="https://github.com/VindiceCode/learngen-blog">repo is shared below</a> - fork it if you want a head start without bootstrapping from Claude Code yourself.

## The Setup

Before Claude Code touched anything, I did some manual prep:

1. Started with a `quickplan.md` doc in the repo - rough goals, nothing fancy
2. Had an old never-deployed domain handy (learngen.io)
3. Set up Vercel deployment connected to the repo - no Claude Code help here

After that, push to remote = blog published. That's the workflow.

## The Architecture

<div style="background: var(--color-code-bg); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--color-accent); margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <strong>My approach:</strong> decompose first, delegate second.
</div>

I asked Claude Code to research what features make a good blog. It came back with search, RSS, tags, reading time, table of contents, related posts. It asked my thoughts on stack - I picked from the list:

- **Astro 5 + MDX** for content
- **Tailwind v4** for styling
- **Vercel** for hosting
- **Cloudflare** for DNS
- **Dark mode** because light mode hurts

Then I told Claude Code to use a <span style="color: var(--color-accent); font-weight: bold;">parallel dev worktrees skill</span> I wrote - a skill that creates git worktrees for each feature, spawns subagent sessions in each one, and lets them work in parallel. That's the whole point: I designed the orchestration, Claude executed it.

*(The parallel dev skill isn't in this repo - after this project, I created a personal Claude Code PM workflow repo with even more additions on how I corral non-deterministic models with deterministic tools. But that's for another blog post.)*

### Worktrees + Parallel Agents

Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories:

```
learngenblog/              # main
learngenblog-worktrees/
  ├── pagefind-search/     # feature branch
  ├── rss-feed/            # feature branch
  └── table-of-contents/   # feature branch
```

Each directory is independent. Run dev servers, make commits - they don't interfere.

Claude Code spawns background agents. Each agent works in its own worktree, on its own feature:

```
Agent 1 → reading-time worktree → implements reading time
Agent 2 → rss-feed worktree → implements RSS
Agent 3 → table-of-contents worktree → implements TOC
```

When they finish, I review the commits, test locally, merge.

<div style="background: var(--color-code-bg); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--color-accent); margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <strong>To those wondering:</strong> did I read any of this code? No. It's a blog, and it renders fast. You're looking at it.
</div>

Worktrees combat where LLMs are weakest: context management. Each agent gets focused scope. No context bloat.

### Tracking Work Against Issues

I had the agents open GitHub issues for each feature, track their work against those issues, and close them after I approved the QA.

Repo is [open source](https://github.com/VindiceCode/learngen-blog) - follow the work as it happens.

## The Content

Once the app was stood up, I had a blog interviewer agent help me capture the basics. I gave it some assets to read - PDFs, Word docs, markdown files, years of unstructured notes. It created an interview I answered.

Most of what it wrote? Marked as drafts. I only published the basic info for the About page to start. I want to be deliberate about the words on this blog - the majority written by me, not AI. Review, iterate, but also: take the roast out of the oven. Put something out there for feedback. That's why the current About is nothing too crazy.

## LearnGen Yourself

<div style="background: var(--color-code-bg); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--color-accent); margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  Clone the repo. Use the blog interviewer agent to write an About Me and first post. Ask Claude to connect it to Vercel, attach Cloudflare DNS. <strong>You'll be as far as I am.</strong>
