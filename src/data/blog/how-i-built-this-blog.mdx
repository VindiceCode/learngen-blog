Built this whole blog in one Claude Code session. Search, tags, RSS, reading time, table of contents, related posts - all of it.

## Stack

- Astro 5 + MDX
- Tailwind v4
- Vercel
- Dark mode because light mode hurts

## The Trick: Worktrees + Parallel Agents

Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories:

```
learngenblog/              # main
learngenblog-worktrees/
  ├── pagefind-search/     # feature branch
  ├── rss-feed/            # feature branch
  └── table-of-contents/   # feature branch
```

Each directory is independent. Run dev servers, make commits, whatever - they don't interfere with each other.

Claude Code can spawn background agents. Each agent works in its own worktree, on its own feature. Three features building at once:

```
Agent 1 → reading-time worktree → implements reading time
Agent 2 → rss-feed worktree → implements RSS
Agent 3 → table-of-contents worktree → implements TOC
```

When they finish, review the commits, test locally, merge.

## What Got Built

**Reading time** - word count estimate, shows "X min read" on posts

**RSS** - standard feed at `/rss.xml`

**Table of contents** - auto-generated from headings, only shows if 2+ headings exist

**Pagefind search** - `Cmd+K` opens search modal, index builds at compile time

**Tags** - click a tag, see all posts with that tag

**Related posts** - matches by shared tags, falls back to recent posts

## Problems

Agents sometimes created files in the wrong worktree. Had to be explicit about paths in prompts.

Merge conflicts when multiple features touch the same files. Rebase and resolve manually.

Pagefind search only works after build - shows "unavailable" in dev mode.

## Process

1. Create GitHub issues for each feature
2. Create worktrees (one per feature)
3. Spawn agents pointing at each worktree
4. Review and test each branch locally
5. Push, create PRs, merge

That's it. Six features, one session.
