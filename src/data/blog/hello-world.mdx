This is the first post on LearnGen.

Real content is coming soon. In the meantime, I'm building out the blog infrastructure and an interview agent to help extract content from my notes and experiences.

## What's Coming

- **How I Built This Blog** - The technical decisions behind this site
- **Dad's BBQ App Case Study** - A project walkthrough

## The Stack

This blog is built with Astro 5, MDX for content, and Tailwind v4 for styling. It's a simple setup that prioritizes fast page loads and a clean reading experience.

### Why Astro?

Astro's content collections make managing blog posts straightforward, and the zero-JS-by-default approach keeps things fast.

### Why MDX?

MDX lets me embed interactive components when needed while keeping most content as simple markdown.

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon.
