Workstream A: The Blog

Repo: VindiceCode/learngenblog Domain: learngen.io (already configured) Deployment: Vercel (already connected, DNS set up)

Existing codebase is trash, no content to keep. Rebuild fresh but keep the Vercel connection and domain config intact.

Output:





Live blog at learngen.io



First post: How I built this blog



Second post: Dad's BBQ app case study



Ongoing posts as new projects ship

Sub-issue: Blog Interviewer Agent

A Claude agent that interviews me to extract content for the blog.





Accepts resources: resume, transcripts, notes, whatever I want to feed it



Asks me questions to surface details I wouldn't think to include



Captures voice—including the more poetic stuff when it fits



Outputs structured material I can use in posts (quotes, background, anecdotes)



Helps define our brand language to use in the blog, so I don't have to discover myself to set up my narrative preferences and tone, who can "sell my journey" as a brand.
